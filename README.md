# React Native Learning Projects

This is a learning project in which covers 10 projects that I did to get more familiar with React Native. To view each individual projects, kindly go to `App.tsx` and there you will find projects commented out. There can only be one project at a time so to view each project, uncomment the project that you want to explore and follow the [Getting Started Guide](#getting-started). Source Codes for each project would be in the projects folder

## Brief Intro to the Projects

### 1) Learning the basics of React Native

Not much to this first project, learnt to setup environments and work with React Native. Much documentations have been read to understand more on the concept of Native and Javascript code

### 2) Cards and Lists

Learnt to use flat list and scroll area view and the differences between the two plus insights on which to use in the near future considering the performance of the app

### 3) Working with Forms in React Native

Explored using [React Hook Form](https://www.react-hook-form.com/) with React Native while integrating [zod](https://zod.dev/) as the schema declaration and validation library

Learnt about coercion using zod

Exposed to npm ui library named [React-Native-Bouncy-Checkbox](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-bouncy-checkbox)

### 4) Pressables

Explored Pressables in React Native, building a background color changer while leveraging on Touchable Opacity

### 5) Roll the Dice

Exposed to working with Images in React Native and also integrated [Haptic FeedBacks](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-haptic-feedback)

Learnt to type components in a better way using PropsWithChildren from React

### 6) Currency Converter

Built a currency converter to strengthen understanding on React Native. Leveraged on [React Native snackbar](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-snackbar) for better UX when validation error occurs

### 7) Tic Tac Toe

Learnt the basics of the logic in determining the winner on a 3 \* 3 tic tac toe game and worked with icons, leveraging on [React-Native-Vector-Icons](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons)

### 8) Spotify Clone

Lerant the basics of working with [React-Native-Track-Player](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-track-player) to work with songs and integrated [React-Native-Community/Slider](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@react-native-community/slider) to display out the progress of the song

### 9) React Native Navigation

Leveraged on [React-Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/) and learnt the concepts of how navigation stack works and the differences between traversing through different screens in web and app

### 10) Iphone Store

Created an Iphone store which contains a detailed page of the Iphones being sold and integrated navigations as a practice to using react-navigation

Learnt about nested navigators and used tab and screen navigators to integrate a shop and music tab in which users can navigate through

## Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

### Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

### Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

#### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

#### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.
